# The ATARI games' screen size is (w,h) = (160*210)
# But when humans play, we scale it according to the following factors.
# *Importance* Therefore, gaze position data is recorded on a screen of size (w*xSCALE, h*ySCALE). 
# And since the neural network is trained on unscaled images (i.e. of size (w,h)), 
# the data preprocess code will use the following constants to map recorded gaze positon back to an unscaled version, 
# that is, by computing (x/xSCALE, y/ySCALE) and feed the result into neural network training. 
NUM_ACTION = 18
xSCALE, ySCALE = 8, 4 # was 6,3
SCR_W, SCR_H = 160*xSCALE, 210*ySCALE
